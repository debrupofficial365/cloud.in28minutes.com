Let's get a quick overview of Google Cloud Deployment Manager from an GCP certification perspective. We will look at important certification questions regarding Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

## Lets consider an example:

- I would want to create a new VPC and a subnet
- I want to provision a Load balancer, Instance groups with 5 Compute Engine instances and an Cloud SQL database in the subnet
- I would want to setup the right Firewall

## AND I would want to create 4 environments

- Dev, QA, Stage and Production!

## Deployment Manager can help you do all these with a simple (actually NOT so simple) script!
