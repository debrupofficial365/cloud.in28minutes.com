#GCP - Getting started

##Before the Cloud - Example 1 - Online Shopping App

###Challenge:
- Peak usage during holidays and weekends
- Less load during rest of the time
###Solution (before the Cloud):
- PEAK LOAD provisioning : Procure (Buy) infrastructure for peak load
- What would the infrastructure be doing during periods of low loads?

##Before the Cloud - Example 2 - Startup

###Challenge:
- Startup suddenly becomes popular
- How to handle the sudden increase in load?
###Solution (before the Cloud):
- Procure (Buy) infrastructure assuming they would be successful
- What if they are not successful?

##Before the Cloud - Challenges

![](../../../presentation-google-cloud/images/load-variations.png)

- High cost of procuring infrastructure
- Needs ahead of time planning (Can you guess the future?)
- Low infrastructure utilization (PEAK LOAD provisioning)
- Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (Can a startup afford it?)

##Silver Lining in the Cloud

- How about provisioning (renting) resources when you want them and releasing them back when you do not need them?
     - On-demand resource provisioning
     - Also called Elasticity

##Cloud - Advantages

- Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- "Go global" in minutes

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

![](../../../presentation-google-cloud/images/00-icons/gcp/google-cloud.png)

- One of the Top 3 cloud service providers
- Provides a number of services (200+)
- Reliable, secure and highly-performant:
  - Infrastructure that powers 8 services with over 1 Billion Users: Gmail, Google Search, YouTube etc
- One thing I love : "cleanest cloud"
  - Net carbon-neutral cloud (electricity used matched 100% with renewable energy)
- The entire course is all about GCP. You will learn it as we go further.

##Best path to learn GCP!

- Cloud applications make use of multiple GCP services
- There is no single path to learn these services independently
- HOWEVER, we've worked out a simple path!
